                   This Bible was printed ca. 1820 on linen paper now yellowed
from age.  At the bottom of a page was written these words: "Miles W. Goldsby
professed a hope in Christ about the 19th of July 1828.  And, Oh, may he live
up to the honor and glory of His name!" The Bible was given to the youngest
daughter, Mrs. W. C. Matthews, by her mother, Mary Ann (Mrs.  Miles Walton)
Goldsby.  Mrs. Matthews gave it to her niece, May Goldsby Smith (Later Mrs. S.
T. Sanders) because she said, after the death of the oldest aunt, Georgie
Goldsby (Mrs.  W.C.) Smith, Memphis, Tenn., this niece wag more interested in
the Goldsby family history than any one.  At Mrs. Sanders' death, it was
acquired by Miss Monita Goldsby, N. Blvd., Baton Rouge, La., who submitted it
for publication June 7, 1960.

                RECORD OF THE LIFE OF PETER RANDOLPH LEATHERMAN

            (Now in the possession of Mrs. Bessie Hill, 601 Kirby, Shreveport,
La. Mrs. Hill  does not know what the relationship is, if any, between her
grandfather, Thomas Leatherman of Claiborne Parish, La., and Peter Leatherman
of Miss.)

                   My father, P. R. Leatherman, was born in Wilkinson Co.,
Miss.  He married Miss Francis Ann Dunckley on her 19th birthday in April or
May. He was five years older than she.
                   In 1853, September 24, I, Mary-Emily Leatherman, was born. 
In 1859, my sister Kate was born.
                   After marrying, Father lived with Grandpa Leatherman two
years, and taught the neighborhood school on Percy's Creek.  Then he taught my
grandpa Dunckley's girls and boys until 1860.  Then he bought his father's old
home in the Donegal neighborhood in Wilkinson County, Miss. We lived there two
years, and he went to the war, fought to the close in the Virginia army, under
Lee.   After the war, he sold his home, and bought Grandpa Dunckley's home,
just 2 1/2 miles from Woodville.   We lived there until after I was married on
January 15, 1874 to George Chestley Netterville.
                   Two years later, when he was about 45 years old, father
went to Tensas Parish, La. with my mother and sister, to manage a plantation
for Mr. Beaty O'Kelley, who had rented two plantations, and was managing one
himself.  Later, father sold the Dunckley place to Mr. O'Kelley and moved to
the Black River, La. plantation bought by Great Grandfather, John King, and
inherited by Grandma Dunckley and her niece Emily King, who later on married
Cousin Frank M. Leatherman.   My grandmother had died, and mother had
inherited her part of that property.
                   In the meantime, my sister had married W. K. Collins in
Louisiana.  He was a Mississippi boy from Franklin County adjoining Wilkinson
County.
                   Father lived on the property mother inherited only a few
years, as they feared the overflow.  He was fortunate enough to sell before
that dreadful flood when the government had to feed the people over there.  He
took that money and bought him a home in Lincoln County, Miss. near
Brookhaven, tried truck farming, but it cost so much to get it to market that
he gave it up.  He taught school at Utitca then went to Franklin County,
Miss., bought a home there in the out-skirts oi a little railroad town, and
taught school there and in Wilkinson county until about two years before he
died, when he sold his home and went to our home, back in Wilkinson County,
and there died of a cancer on his face.
                   All of this time his friends and relatives knew where he
was, so I cannot imagine what you meant by asking me if my father was the
Peter Leatherman who disappeared from Mississippi.  I never heard of any other
Peter Leatherman, and I am a pretty old woman.  There are a number of people
in Wilkinson County who can swear to the statement.
                                            Mary L. Netterville.

GIDEON WHITE BIBLE
Holy Bible. Published by J. Emory and B. Waugh for the Methodist Episcopal
Church at the conference office at 14 Crosby Street; Azor Hoyt, Printer, New
York, 1828. In possession of Mrs. Mary Haney Sanderson, Clinton, La.  Copied
September 21, 1960, by Mrs. J. P. Morris, Jr., Kentwood, La.

Inside the back cover, in pencil: "April the 27, 1879. Gideon White, his book.
Bought 1829, Price $3.00." The Bible held a treasury of various items. A
beautifully written baptismal record gives "Alamon and Nancy White" as the
parents of Gideon White baptized 1831. The names of these parents are also
found in a clipping written at the time of Gideon's death. The baptismal
record also gives the parents of Gideon's wife, for the last entry states,
"Eleanor Stokes, daughter of Thomas and Eleanor Stokes was baptized by Rev.
Winans in 1828 at the same time her sister, Elizabeth H. White, was baptized."

Newspaper Clipping: IDENTIFIED: The body of the man found drowned at the
head of Pleasant street on Tuesday, has been identified as that of Junius
McCantz, secretary of the Grain Trimmers Benevolent Association.  Mr.  McCantz
left his home, corner Louisiana Avenue and Prytania street, last
Sunday morning and was last seen alone at two o'clock Sunday afternoon.
It is believed that he stooped over the edge of the wharf to get a drink of
water out of the river and lost his balance and fell overboard.  His head
striking a pile he was knocked insensible and unable to save himself.   This
theory would account for the contusions found on the head of the drowned man. 
(This is Junius C. McCants of New Orleans - no date given).

1943, at 7:30 o'clock p.m., Helen Minerva Anderson, wife of the late Junius

DOUGLAS ALLEN BIBLE

This record submitted to the Society through the DAR by Mrs. Paul Stinson,
Jonesboro, La. This record has come to Louisiana from La Grange, Iowa, Lucas
County. The Bible was printed by the American Bible Society, New York,
MDCCCXVI. Notes are copied below:

Mrs. Josephine Swift Donelson, of 3965 Sycamore St. Baton Rouge La. wrote and
asked me to copy the old family records of Douglas Allen, from his old Bible,
which was left in our care by Ursel Allen Cassity, (youngest sister of John H.
Allen, Deceased) I suppose it is much over 100 years old, as Douglas Allen was
first married to Anna Alison, in 1819, then again to Mrs, Azubah Hart, in
1863, who was the mother of Laura Hart Swift, mother of Josephine.

As the two leaves of the old Bible containing the family records were loose, I
just removed and sent them to Josephine, instead of copying them. So am
leaving this explanation in the Bible for future generations. 

Signed --
Elsie Chambers Allen, wife of John H. Allen, 
son of Milton Harvey Allen, son of, Douglas Allen.
 2814 61st. Des Moines, Iowa. 

Jan. 22, 1951
The old Bible was sent to me in just a few weeks later, as her daughter wanted
me to have it, as she had no one to leave it to, that would be interested
enough in it, to value it. I am trying to figure out the person or persons
that I will leave it to. The coming generations don't seem to be interested in
the past any more, but here is this record,


Page 78.

and this Grandfather of mine was a wonderful person, and his past should be
recorded. He was over six feet tall, and had red hair, and was never idle a
minute, was a great Churchman, and a good man. What more can you say, "A
GOOD MAN".
/s/ Josephine Swift Donelson
2965 Sycamore St., Baton Rouge, La.

Douglas Allen, son of Joseph and Frances Allen, was born in Virginia October
29, 1799, and in 1819 was married to Anna Alison, by whom he had eleven
children, four of whom died in early childhood. (These 4 children died within
a weeks time of each other, of some mysterious. illness). They moved to
Indiana in 1837, to Davis County, Iowa in 1844, thence to Lucas County in
1849. Here Anna Allen died, Jan. 4th, 1863. He and his first wife were charter
members of the La Grange, Iowa Cumberland Presbyterian Church, being among the
very earliest settlers of the county, was one of the first elders of that
congregation. He was blind some years before his death. Was buried in the La
Grange Cemetery having donated the land for this burying ground, some years
before. This cemetery is still being used for burials, and kept in very good
condition. His death occurred May 14, 1884.

WILLIAM ELY FREEMAN BIBLE

Holy Bible originally owned by the parents of Zachariah Canty Freeman, the
grandfather of Lurline Richardson Aspin, 5536 Belmont Avenue, Cincinnati, 24,
Ohio, a member of the Society who is originally from Louisiana, and who
submitted this record March, 1961.

The family record pages and a few sheets from the Apocrypha are now owned by a
granddaughter of the original owners, Miss Louise Shaver, Route 2, Grady,
Alabama. Mrs. Aspin copied from the original in August, 1960, and now has
photostats in her possession. Louise Shaver is a daughter of Ella

Page 183

Freeman Shaver, youngest daughter by a second marriage of Joseph Alston
Freeman. Three sons of Sarah Gaulden Freeman settled in Louisiana and had
numerous descendants: John Gaulden Freeman, James Irvin Freeman, and
Zachariah Canty Freeman, as did descendants of her son Joseph Alston Freeman.

The newspaper obituary quoted below is also in possession of Louise Shaver.
Other family records indicate that Sarah Gaulden Freeman's mother was Susan
Brumfield; that her parents were married in P.E., Va. and some of the older
children were born there; and that they moved to South Carolina before the
Revolution.

Early Virginia records have the name spelled Goulding; in Louisiana it has
been found Gaulden, Goulden, Gouldin, Gauldin, Gaulding, etc.

The father of William Ely Freeman was said to have been a Columbus Freeman who
came to Culpepper Co., Va. in the early 1700's from Scotland. Since William
Ely was not born until 1768 this Freeman lived in Sumter Dist., S.C., all his
children were born there, and Mrs. Aspin believes he died there before Sarah
and some of the children moved to Montgomery Co., Ala.

OBITUARY

"Died at her residence in the county of Montgomery, Ala., on the 2d of
February, 1856, Mrs. SARAH FREEMAN, consort of Eli Freeman, in the 78 year of
her age. She was a native of Sumter District, South Carolina, and a daughter
of Capt. John and Susan Goulding, natives of Prince Edward, Virginia. Capt.
Goulding served in the Revolutionary War under General Marion, and died of
smallpox. The elder brother of the deceased served under Gen. Green. She
joined the Methodist church on her death bad. Signed "P.W.S." whom descendants
say was a minister.  Probably P. W. Spear as court records show that Charles
B. Lloyd & Eliza Canty were married in 1852 by a P.W. Spear, O.G.P. (probably
Ordained Gospel Preacher ?)

as early as 1790 (and perhaps earlier), a number of marriage and baptismal
records relating to them are at St. Martin's Church at St. Martinville. Most
of the family went on to Texas with the Stephen Austin Colony, although I

ELIAS MOLING BIBLE

Record submitted to the Society by Mrs. Della B. Krause (Mrs. R. E.) Lake
Charles, La. She is a great great  granddaughter of Katarine Molling, born
1827, who married Capt. Daniel Goos. Her mother, Anna Marie Garig Moeling,
lived in Lake Charles with them until her death, so until that time her
grandchildren were listed in her Bible. There are several differences in the
spelling. Katarina changed to the American Katherine; Moling or Molling now is
Moeling, since two dots over the "o" give it that sound.  The Bible is in
possession of Miss Florence Rosenthal, Lafayette, La.  She allowed Mrs. Krause
to take photostats of the record, and she sent one, with the original German
script, to the Society, as well as a typed copy of the translation.

"The Bible was that of Elias Moling and his wife Anna Marie Gerig who 
was from Naystatau der Hart. She did not die until 1878, and the last 
entry is 1855, and only seven of the fifteen children of Capt. Daniel 
Johannes Goos and Katherine Molling are listed. She must have been 
too busy caring for her grandchildren to keep the entries up to date." 
It is also to be regretted that she made no entries for marriages or deaths.

BIBLE OF BERENICE ROXANNA QUINN NORMAN

CLIPPINGS

"T. J. (Thomas Jefferson) Wingard was born in Lexington County 
(S.C.) on February 21, 1840. He lived until March 22, 1928, 
making his stay on earth 88 years, 1 month, and ten days. 
He married Charlotte Satcher in 18--(67). His wife preceded 
him to her heavenly home years ago.. To this union were born 
four children, two boys and two girls, all of whom are living but 
one girl. He leaves 28 grandchildren and 25 great-grand children 
to mourn his passing. He was ill only ten days before his 
Heavenly Father called him home to rest. He was a member 
of the Methodist church, although he did not attend the services 
in his later years because of failing hearing and eye sight. He 
was a good Christian Man. We shall all miss him very much. 
May the parting not be long. May his life guide us all into the 
Heavenly portals, safe at last. By his Loved Ones, Shiro, Texas." 

(Probably from Shiro, Grimes Co., Texas, newspaper)
"B. R. Norman died February 29, 1919. She was 78 years old on 
August 12, 1919. She was a consistent member of the Methodist 
church. Survivors include a daughter, Mrs. J. P. Rickard of Houston, 
Sam Norman of Sour Lake, J. P. Norman of Pankey, Mahlon and 
Lem of Shiro, two brothers, Rufus Quinn of Houston, and L. W. D. 
Quinn of Iola."

"Lon E. Norman died of cancer of the throat at the age of 49 years 
old (no date given). He is survived by three children, Mrs. Prince 
Jolly, Mrs. Earl Shelman, Miss Lonice Norman, by five brothers, 
M. R. and L.M., Shiro, J.P. of Iola, D.W. of Singleton, Sam of 
Dobbin, and a sister, Mrs. Reid Rickard. Lon E. Norman started 
the first drugstore in Shiro."

NOTE: Mrs. A. K. Bourgeous, Arizona who submitted the record to the society
in April, 1961, also made the following notations:

"The maiden name of Gibson Collins' wife was Elizabeth Wheatley, of 
Wilkes Co., Georgia, daughter of Joseph Wheatley.
The initials of B. J. Quinn, who married Sarah Ann Collins stood for 
Barnett Jeter Quinn. He was the son of William Quinn Jr. and Rhoda 
Statham of Lincoln and Wilkes Co., Georgia.
The initials L. W. D. Quinn stood for Leonidas William Davis Quinn.
Gibson Collins, to whom the Bible first belonged, evidently passed it 
down to his daughter Sarah Ann Collins Quinn, who in turn passed it 
down to her daughter, Berenice Roxanna Quinn Norman, who in turn 
passed it down to her son, and my grandfather, Mahlon Roswell Norman. 
The Bible now in the possession of my aunt, Mrs. Alver (Willie Bowen) 
Rhoton, Shiro, Texas, is in poor shape now. A photostatic copy is 
owned by Mrs. L. G. Highnote, Corsicana, Texas. My copy 
is one I myself made about five years ago. I do not know when the 
Bible was published, but feel very sure the date given as its being bought 
(1827) is accurate. Delhi, Wilkes Co., is no more. It was once a crossroad 
settlement on the road from Washington to Elberton, Georgia. There is 
nothing there on the map any more.

My great-grandparents, John Lemuel Norman and Berenice Roxanna 
Quinn, moved from Wilkes Co., Ga. to Grimes Co., Texas about 1874.

Miss. in 1834 under the ministry of Thomas Griffin. He was licensed to 
exhort in 1835 by Rev. J.I.E. Byrd, licensed to preach in 1847 at Shiloh 
Campground, ordained a deacon by Bishop Pierce in 1856. In 1859 he 
joined the Congregational Methodist Church and remained an elder and 
pastor in that church until 1873 when he returned to the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South and was admitted to the Mississippi Methodist Conference 
at Brandon, Miss. and appointed to the Thomastown Circuit. In 1874 he 
was appointed to the Carthage Circuit but at the close of that year, owing
to bodily infirmation, he located....

Brother Davis died suddenly of dropsy of the heart on August 9, 1882, but 
his earnest, faithful life was enough. He was twice married. First to Mrs. 
Julia (Shelby) Mills in 1836, then to Miss A. E. Hendrix in 1862 who 
survives him. His body rests from its labors in the graveyard at Goshen 
Church, Leake Co. where most of his work was done. L.P. Meador.

Obituary from the New Orleans Christian Advocate, May 1, 1879:

William Hendrix was born in the Lexington Dist. of South Carolina on 
Nov. 28, 1796 and died suddenly of heart disease at his home in Leake 
Co. Miss. on the evening of April 5, 1879. Our venerated father became 
the subject of God's converting grace in Dallas Co., Ala. in the year 1820 
and soon thereafter joined the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, near 
Monroeville, Ala. in which vicinity he settled, married and lived until his 
removal to Leake Co. Miss. in 1847. As soon as convenient after his arrival 
at his new home, he and the members of his family who were connected 
with the church presented their certificates and were regularly admitted at 
Goshen, Carthage Dist.

In the year 1848 he lost his loved companion, the mother of his children, 
three sons and eight daughters. She was a helpmate indeed and a true 
and devoted Christian. His life was one of varied cares and responsibilities, 
but he moved on calmly and contentedly and industriously, ever trusting, 
never dispairing, believed that He in whom he trusted would do right.

He was a man of unquestioned honesty and integrity, a lover of the truth, 
and followed fully the injunction of the Apostle, "Owe no man". He was a 
man of peace, never heard to speak ill of any. Was a dear lover of the Bible 
and read it through many times; he read it prayerfully and understandingly; 
he was a man of prayer and was a regular attendant at church as long as 
he was able to walk there. He freely and conscientiously gave of his means 
to support the gospel as long as he lived and said, "After I am dead I want 
the church to live". He lived to see all of his children members of the
church, married and settled and all survived him but one. The writer knew him
well and intimately and can exclaim" "Let me die the death of the righteous
and let me last end be like his". O.H.P. Davis (Son-in-law).

In possession of Charlie Holcombe Pitcher, Baton Rouge, who submitted this

Sally Burritt Bangs, wife of Rev. Heman Bangs was born on August 3, 
 1789 in Danbury, Conn. and died August 19, 1864, just 9 days after 
 the letter was written, to her daughter Rachel Ann Wisner Bangs, born
 Nov. 21, 1820, who died in Louisiana or Mississippi in 1868. She
 married Reverend Benjamin Jones on June 11, 1844 in New York. The 
 "Stephen" in the letter is Stephen Bangs Jones, and Natty is his 
 brother, Nathaniel Magruder Jones. Both were sons of Rev. Benjamin 
 Jones and his wife Rachel Ann Wisner Bangs Jones. 

Page 57

My Dear Rachel,
I am weak and feeble, my trust is in the Lord. I was seventy
five last Wednesday. I would love, Dear Rachel, to see you and 
yours, Precious Mr. Jones, precious Stephen, precious Natty. 
Heaven bless them all and your own dear self. My hope is in God. 
He is my rock of Salvation and sure defense.
Your affectionate,  Mother"

    Holy Bible, American Bible Society, New York, 1852, found in the 
    books and papers of the Reames family who had kept boarders and 
    roomers for many years, and were Methodists for the last several 
    generations. The small Bible has been destroyed, but the Family 
    Record page and publication page have been placed in the files of 
    the Society by Mrs. J. P. Morris, Jr. Her husband was a Reames 
    descendant. The two family names mentioned in the only entry in 
    the old Bible are unconnected to the Reames family, as far 
    as is known.

    BENJAMIN JONES RECORD

    This record is taken from a clipping, probably from the Methodist 
    Christian Advocate, pasted into a journal which belonged to 
    Rachel Ann Wisner Bangs, wife of Rev. Benjamin Jones, whose 
    Bible Record (see page 56 of this Volume) has been submitted 
    to the Society by Charlie Holcombe Pitcher of Baton Rouge. 
    Benjamin Jones was her great grandfather. Mrs. Pitcher says 
    Rachel A. W. B. Jones was born Nov. 21, 1820. Her mother, 
    Sally Burritt, was born in Danbury, Conn. Aug. 3, 1789 and 
    married Heman Bangs who was born in Fairfield, Conn. April 
    15, 1790.
    Another clipping from the journal, not copied in full, tells of the 
    death on Sunday, Oct. 29 (no year) on board a steamer, on 
    the Mississippi River, 100 miles below St. Louis, of Annie 
    Clinton (Jones) aged 1 year and 11 months, only daughter 
    of Rev. Benjamin W. B. Jones of Jackson, Louisiana, and 
    granddaughter of Rev. H. Bangs "of this city."
    This obituary of Rev. Jones is long, but will be of interest to 
    many early Methodist families not directly connected because 
    there are clues here as to where to look for records of Louisiana 
    people - for example, in Arkansas Conference records for the 
    period before 1840.

    IN MEMORIAM

    Benjamin Jones was born in Campbell County, Va., Dec. 15, 
    1809 and died at Long Beach, Miss. June 20, 1893. Of his 
    parentage and early life very little is known except that his 
    father's name was John and his mother's Magdalen, and that 
    they were both members of the Methodist Church. In his seventh 
    year, the family moved to Kentucky, and in his twenty-first, 
    Benjamin came to Mississippi, locating at Natchez, where he 
    engaged in business as a builder . .... his choice of a life work. 
    In 1835, in the class with Elijah Steele and William H. Watkins, 
    he was received on trial into the Mississippi Conference, which 
    then embraced also the territory of the State of Louisiana. His 
    first pastoral charge was Alexandria. In the following year the 
    General Conference transferred all of Louisiana, except the 
    Florida parishes, to the Arkansas Conference, and thus the 
    name of Benjamin Jones, who was returned to the same charge, 
    does not appear in the Mississippi Conference Minutes until the 
    secession of the territory mentioned by act of the General 
    Conference of 1840. In the meantime he had been ordained deacon 
    at Little Rock, in 1837, and admitted to elder's orders and ordained 
    at Opelousas, Louisiana in 1839. His service in Louisiana, though 
    a hard one, operated only to prove his loyalty to the Master and to 
    confirm that rare combination of self reliance and faith in God which 
    was one of his most prominent characteristics. In that ungrateful 
    soil it was his privilege, while sowing with his own hand the seed 
    of the kingdom, to water also that which had been planted by Winans, 
    Drake and Clinton.

    If every reader of this sketch were well acquainted with the movement 
    of Methodism in Mississippi and Louisiana during the last half century, 
    the Advocate might well spare the space for a complete list of Bro. 
    Jones' appointments in the fifty-six years over which his active 
    ministerial life extended. A few only need be mentioned to show 
    the variety and extent of the service which he rendered to the Church.



    Page 128

    At the Conference of 1849 he was appointed to Woodville station, in 
    1841 to Wilkinson circuit, and in 1842 and 1843 to Centenary College 
    and Brandon. To this latter work and its associations was due, in 
    some measure, his ardent interest in education and his prominent 
    connection with the work of the church in that field. During his pastorate 
    here a wonderful revival swept the college, and made upon the community 
    an impression which abides to this day. In a letter to the presiding
    elder, Bro. Drake, at the end of his first year, Prof. W. H. N. Magruder
    of the college faculty, writes as follows: "The subject that fills my mind
    most at this time is the return of Bro. Jones to this place. His talents
    command the respect, and his deportment as a minister and friend is such
    as to secure the affection of the young men. They are all anxious to have
    him returned. "

    Among the Mississippi delegates to the eventful General Conference 
    of 1844 the name of B. Jones appears as alternate. While in attendance 
    upon this great convention he was married, on June 11, to Miss R.A.W., 
    daughter of Rev. Heman Bangs, pastor of Forsythe Street Church, in 
    New York City. To this union were born two sons, Steven and Nathaniel - 
    both successful and pious men, the former a merchant in Baton Rouge 
    and the other a lawyer in Chicago.

    Upon the removal of Centenary College to Jackson, La., Bro. Jones was 
    made its agent, having spent the two previous years in charge of Natchez 
    station. His work in 1847 and '48 was Feliciana circuit, in former of
    which years he established in Jackson the Feliciana Female Seminary, an 
    institution which, under his prudent management and the tutelage of his 
    gifted wife; had a large success, having among its graduates some of the 
    first women of Mississippi and Louisiana. Yielding to a conviction that it 
    was not in accordance with the spirit of the Discipline for itinerant 
    preachers to engage in private business of any kind, he located in 1851, 
    but continued to preach regularly in the churches about Jackson, 
    Clinton and Bayou Sara.

    In 1856 he took charge of Port Gibson Collegiate Academy, and, being 
    re-admitted into the Conference, was appointed to Port Gibson, Grand 
    Gulf and Colored Mission. Subsequently, while connected with the 
    Academy, he served various charges in the surrounding country. From 
    1861 to '65, the school having suspended on account of the war, he was 
    presiding elder of Fayette district; the latter year, while on the
    Brookhaven district, he was elected to the General Conference of 1866.
    While he was pastor of Wesson and Beauregard charge in 1868, Mrs. Jones
    died after a long illness, leaving upon her many former pupils and a large
    circle of acquaintances the impress of a rarely cultured and consecrated  
    life.

    In 1869 he was again called to the presidency of Port Gibson Collegiate 
    Academy, and in February of the following year was married to Mrs. M. A. 
    Redding, whose daughter, Alice, is the wife of Rev. G. A. Oates, of the 
    Los Angeles Conference. With her he lived happily until her death at 
    Woodville, Miss. in 1880. In 1871 he resigned his position in the Academy 
    and returned to the pastorate, being appointed to Summit and Magnolia. 
    From this time, though indirectly connected for a year or two with


    Page 129

    Woodville Female Seminary, he gave himself to pastoral work.

    In 1881, he was married to Mrs. Rebeca Wylie, daughter of E.H. Wailes, 
    Esq. of Woodville, who survives him. Bro. Jones' last pastoral charge was 
    Clinton., La., from which at the end of his second year he came to the 
    Conference of 1891 and was superanualted at his own request. With 
    characteristic forethought, he had arranged to open a school at Long 
    Beach, on the Gulf Coast, and to this work he devoted himself for the 
    next eighteen months. Being unable to attend the Conference session 
    of 1892, he wrote to his brethren an affectionate letter, full of
    gratitude to God for his abiding grace, and closing in his own quaint way,
    "Permit me to say, Brethren, Glory to God. "

    The last days of Bro. Jones' life were calm and peaceful. The Sunday 
    before his last on earth, though quite unwell, he went as usual to the 
    house of God. A large congregation was present expecting service by 
    the pastor; but as he was unable to preach, Bro. Jones, at his request, 
    went into the pulpit and for half an hour, spoke out of a full heart in
    his clear, practical way on the Golden Text of the morning's Sunday School 
    lesson: "Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord."
    It was a congenial topic, and the words spoken were with the power and 
    unction of the Spirit. The congregation were gravely attentive, softened 
    and subdued in the presence of the one who had daily lived before them 
    the higher Christian life he was portraying. For several days following he
    worked in the garden, as was his custom, and helped about the house, 
    but toward the end of the week his illness assumed a form which made 
    necessary a painful and dangerous operation. From this, owing to his 
    unwonted vigor and strictly temperate habit, he rallied, but fever
    setting in, he gradually grew worse, and died at mid-day of June 20.
    When told by the physicians that the end was near, he said calmly, "I 
    do not feel like a dying man; I am not afraid to die, but cannot believe 
    my work is done." He had long prayed that he might have a quiet death, 
    and those who gathered about his bedside felt that the prayer was 
    answered. To die was all he had to do. To his wife, and to his son, 
    Steven, who had come in answer to a telegram, he gave a few directions 
    as to his burial, dictated a letter to his younger son in Chicago, and 
    one to Dr. Thornton concerning his superannuate's portion, and tried to 
    send a message to his brethren, but his strength failing, he straitened 
    himself in bed and waited for the summons.

    In the evening of the last day a neighbor sang for him a favorite hymn, 
    "Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound." At the last verse he raised his 
    hands and feebly tried to shout. A little while after as he lay looking 
    outward the gates of Heaven, seemed to be thrown wide open, "And from 
    a happy place God's glory smote him on the face."

    When one of the watchers in awed tones exclaimed, "How beautiful," he 
    answered faintly, "Shining, shining." Again they sang a song of Christian 
    triumph.

    Page 130

    "They saints in all this glorious war Shall conquer, though they 
    die," and again the light flooded his countenance, and God's 
    presence filled the room. Thus conscious to the last, with 
    heaven all about him, he fell asleep in Jesus, and was laid to 
    rest at the cemetery at Woodville.

    The barest outline of a life so long and so eminently useful as 
    that of Bro. Jones touches the limit of the ordinary obituary; 
    but a few words may be added as showing more particularly, 
    his character and the estimation in which he was held by more 
    than one generation of good men.

    Writing of him in his earlier life, Prof. Magruder says: "I first met 
    Bro. Jones at my brother-in-law's, Mr. Drake's, in 1836, and was 
    greatly impressed with the earnestness of his convictions and 
    the courage of his purpose to master the assigned courses of 
    study and to make of himself what he became, a true, faithful 
    and efficient worker in the Lord's vineyard.
    ... You ask my estimate of the man and the ministry. I have 
    never risen spiritually to the measure of Bro. Jones' Christian 
    life, and could not adequately express my own estimate of his 
    character. I never knew a purer man, nor a character more 
    equable nor better poised. He possessed, and in all the 
    relations of life exhibited, all the qualities of a true man. 
    As husband, father, friend, he lacked not one. I always classed 
    him among the best preachers of our church. As a sermonizer, 
    he was logical, spiritual, with an unaffected earnestness that 
    was impressive without the slightest approach to fanaticism. 
    He was remarkable for the purity of his English, and his delivery, 
    though unpretentious, was in what I have always considered the 
    highest style of oratory."
    From an acquaintance which began nearly forty years afterward, 
    Bishop Galloway writes:
    "He had clear conceptions, What he claimed to know, he knew 
    well. His range of thought was not as wide as that of some 
    others, but I have known no man more accurate in knowledge, 
    or more perspicious in statement. His distinct, deliberate 
    enunciation indicated the clearness of his conceptions and the 
    firmness of his convictions of truth. On these convictions he 
    would stand to martydom. He was a model of manly and ministerial 
    dignity, agreeable as a companion, prudent as a pastor, and in 
    every relation of life above suspicion or complaint. He was 
    scrupulously careful as to his financial credit. He avoided debt, 
    as he would flee from the wrath to come. There will be no claims 
    against the estate of Benjamin Jones. Bro. Jones was a theologian. 
    He had mastered the "standards" and made them his own. 
    Though an independent thinker, he never aped originality nor 
    posed as a reformer. Subscribing to the doctrines of Methodism, 
    he stated them luminously, and illustrated them in his own 
    modest, consistent, consecrated life."

    Page 131

    Bro. Jones was a model superannuate. In this difficult relation he bore
    himself with sweetness and dignity. He was helpful to his pastors, visited
    the sick, and worked for the Master without compensation, giving no sign
    of weariness or complaint. In addition to teaching through the week, he
    preached regularly once, and often twice a day, on three Sundays in the
    month. Honoring the past, loyal to the "old paths," he yet trusted the
    church and looked with steady faith to the future.
    Of his life work, that which seems most rare and in structure is what he
    did for education. With but few advantages in early life, he was an
    honored agent in the school work of the church; he helped to lay the
    foundation of Centenary College; built up two flourishing schools for
    young women, and was largely instrumented in securing the conveyance
    of the original Whitworth College property to the Mississippi Conference.
    He was the contemporary in more than years of three generations of great
    and godly men, and through a long life stood abreast with every advance
    movement of the church.

    As a man, he was eminent for personal integrity and love of truth. During
    the Conference of 1891 he said to Bro. Perry Drake and this writer:
    "If either of you should be called on to write my obituary, I want you to
    be sure to avoid the common error of giving undue praise. I want the truth
    and nothing but the truth told of me."
    As a Christian, he was characterized by the satisfying fullness of his
    faith in God. As early as 1839, writing to his friend, B. M. Drake, he
    thanks him for counsel which had settled his views of the doctrine and
    experience of sanctification. Whatever may be thought of this higher
    spiritual attainment, there is no doubt that when God called Benjamin
    Jones into his service he called all of him, and the whole man answered,
    "Here am I" For more than three-score years he walked with God, as friend
    with friend, and then like Enoch "he was not, for God took him." "Mark the
    perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace."
    R. S. Ricketts.

    MORGAN MORGAN RECORD

    This record was submitted to the Society by Mrs. Robert M. McGill,
Jackson, La. and Mrs. E. Kittredge Sims, <address deleted>, Shreveport, La.
The old Morgan Bible is now in possession of Mrs. A. H. Starkey of Central,
La,<address deleted> , Baton Rouge. She was Donna Edwards, daughter of Mattie
Morgan Edwards. The Bible is all to pieces, but photostats of the record are
also in existence. Some of the later records are on the blank sheets after
"Revelations."   Mrs. Sims thinks it possible that Morgan Morgan was a son of
John and Martha (Constant) Morgan of Hampshire, Co., Va., now West Virginia,
and that it is very likely that John Morgan, father of Morgan Morgan was a
grandson of Edward Morgan mentioned on page 543 of "The Boone Family." The
record of the 12th child, Daniel, born 1802, is added here. Court records of
East Feliciana Parish prove he was a son of Morgan and Jane Boone Morgan.
Birth of twins in last page of loose pages in Bible and believe next page lost
which had Daniel's birth.

    A notarized copy of this record was submitted to the Society 29 Feb. 1963
    by Mrs. Inez Jackson George, 718 Pearce Road, Pineville, La.
    
              The Bible, published in 1854 by Lippincott, Grambo & Co.,
         Philadelphia, is in possession of Mrs. W. F. Cain, Bossier City, La.
    
         It is to be noted that an allied McGehee record is to be found in
         Be It Known and Remembered, Vol. II, pp. 32-35. A book, Genealogy of
         Wilkinson and Allied Families, pp. 229 and 405, also has some related
         information. Mrs. George said, "The families were from Amite County,
         Miss.
         The Jacksons (from whom the Toler mentioned in the records
         originates),  Cains, Butlers, Whittingtons and Wilkinsons came from
         Georgia in 1800 to Mississippi. They intermarried into McGehee
         families who are descended from Richard Scott who came from England
         to Boston in 1634 in the ship,  "Griffin".
    
              Mrs. George sent a copy of this record also to John H. Parker of
         Liberty, Miss., who also sent a photocopy to the Society together
         with a brochure on the history of Bossier City, La. It tells that
         Bossier became a village in 1907 on the site of Cain's Landing, first
         settled by the Cain family in the 1830's.

    Addenda by Mr. Griggs:
    
    Not shown in the records is the fact that George Richard Griggs and Mary
    Glandfield and their children lived in London, England. Understand that
    their son, John Christopher, was born when they were on a visit to the
    U.S.A. My Father always said that when they reached the age of 21 they
    were given a trip to the U.S.A. (My Father was a British subject). His
    sister Mary Griggs married Charlie Chaff of Minden, La., and after she
    died, the other sister who came to take care of her sister's children
    also married. They tell the tale that whenever the Bishop went to Minden,
    he always took dinner with Uncle Charlie. He did not know the first
    sister had died and he was complementing Mrs. Chaff on how much younger
    and prettier she had gotten since his last visit. When he found out the
    first sister had passed on, he was awfully embarrassed.

         was built at the same time, and his parents moved into it when he
         was about 2 weeks old, so ca. 1891. He also says that it was the
         site of a former Indian camp, for in earlier days, there were many
         artifacts to be found surrounding a hard clay level cleared area
         there.

    Springs Church, in Tangipahoa Parish, La., but that the house had been
    blown away in "that awful storm." She believed there had been no "s" on
    the end of Schilling "till brother Rolley went in service, and started
    using an "s", and that some cousins in Texas whom brother Theodore visited
    (Iley, possibly) omitted the "c" in spelling.

    Nine pages of mimeographed material were submitted 30 Sept. 1963 by Dr.

    His wife is interested in data pertaining to NOAH GRIFFITH who came
     to Montgomery Co., near Dobbin, Texas ca 1829. One of his sons married
     Angelina Dickinson who escaped from the Alamo with her mother.

    Mr. Burnam says that this family also uses the spelling BURNHAM. He
    believes Henry Thompson Burnham (whose Bible record is given here) to be
    probably a descendant of Hickerson Burnam, a brother of Captain Jesse
    Burnam.  Jesse was born 15 Sept. 1792 in Madison County, Kentucky and said
    to be one of the oldest of the Texas veterans, serving under General
    Houston.

    The mimeographed data list 16 children of Captain Jesse Burnam and also
    additional material about Fowler, Baldridge, Faris, Alexander and Sharp
    families.

    The following information is contained in the Holy Bible of the Burnam
    Family. This Bible was printed in 1848. (Dates and spellings are same as
    in Bible).

    The library of the First Baptist Church in Kentwood, Louisiana was
    presented a 120-page bound typescript by Clyde Alonzo Thorpe three days
    before his death 10 April 1966 at the age of 98. This typing had
    occupied his time for some months after failing eyesight made him give
    up his woodworking hobby. From it, your editor abstracts these data
    which may also be of interest in other parts of the United States.
    
                              RECORD

    been born in France. They had 2 daughters and 3 sons. Many of the family
    were barristers and politicians. One of the children, Sarah Alvira Lemmon
    born 1836 Sandusky City, Ohio, died Beaman, Iowa, had married 1859 in
    Clyde, Ohio to William Monroe Thorpe who had been born in Buffalo, New
    York in 1835. His father was William Thorpe, a wheelright whose family had
    come from England in early colonial days.   Someone in the family has said
    they were from the Isle of Man.
    
    William Thorpe and his wife Alvira Hoak had 3 dau. and 4 sons. The Hoak
    family had come from Liverpool, England. William Monroe Thorpe was the

    he started in his young days west from Ohio in a covered wagon on either
    side of which was a sign, "We wrestle all comers for money, chalk or
    marbles." They began the journey with 2 head of horses and $50 in cash and
    arrived in Marshaltown, Iowa with 6 head and $700.

                       LANIER FAMILY GENEALOGICAL TREE
    
    Taken from the Family Records of Mr. Lee Lanier of Amite, La. Submitted to
    the Society by Mrs. Kathryne Watkins, Hammond, La., State Librarian of
    Louisiana Daughters of the American Revolution.
    
    Jerome Lanier of Brodeaux, France in 1558 emigrated with his family to
    England, in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Jerome was a
    Huguenot who  fled from execution or persecution and finding himself
    without means in a foreign land availed himself of his accomplishments and
    secured a position in Queen Elizabeth's household as Court musician. He
    found great favor at the court and for about one hundred years - 1558 to
    1666 - the Laniers flourished in England, distinguished themselves in
    music, art and military genius. They were a family of means and culture in
    France. Jerome Lanier had three sons:  Nicholas, Clement and Jerome.
    
                                                                       
    Nicholas Lanier was born in 1568, he was the most prominent of Jerome's
    sons. He enjoyed high favor under James the 7th reign and especially so
    under Charles the 7th's reign. English history says of him that he was one
    of those artists whose various talents were so noticeable as to suit the
    taste of Charles the 7th. He gathered Charles the 7th's collection of
    paintings. He was a skilled musician, artist and courier. Five of his
    famous paintings are distributed as follows: one owned by Van Dyke, one in
    the collection of Charles the 7th, one now in the music hall of Oxford.
    Two owned by the Prince of Wales. He died in 1648 leaving two sons:
    Nicholas, Jr. and John Thomas Lanier.
    
    Nicholas Lanier, Jr., brother of John Thomas Lanier who migrated to
    America in 1683; was also a noted musician and artist. He was frequently
    seen at the court of England. He was made president of the English Society
    of Musicians
    
    
Page 133

    and Artists for life. He enjoyed many favors from the King. Other members 
    of the Society were Clement, Andreu, and Jerome. These appear to be of
    another branch of Laniers.

     (Comment of J. B. Lanier Plooard - 1947 - Apparently history closes out
    all branches of the family who may have remained in England and the
    Laniers in America seem to be descendants of John Thomas Lanier and
    Elizabeth Washington, the aunt of George Washington.)

     Jerome Lanier lives in a palatial house in Greenwich, was a great and
    famous musician. Owned the greatest collection of paintings than in
    existence. He had only one son.

     Sir John Lanier in 1690 comes again in history of being knighted "Knight
    of his valor, in the capture of Castle of Edinboro. He was Major General
    of the "Horse & Dragon." In the Irish war made himself prominent in Battle
    of Boyne and fell at Battle of Steinkiek fighting gloriously along with
    the brave Douglas. This closes his story as far as we know of Clement and
    Jerome Lanier, so the family name was apparently perpetuated by the
    descendants of the son Nicholas Lanier. They may have had daughters.

     John Thomas Lanier, son of Nicholas and grandson of Jerome was from
    Bordeaux in 1603 to America with John Washington. He brought much of the
    family furniture with him. He was given a grant of 10 miles or 1400 acres
    of land on the South of James River and it included what is now Richmond,
    located in what is now counties of Prince George, Brunswick, etc. He
    subsequently moved to North Carolina (North border) and was very
    prominent. In 1688 he married Elizabeth Washington, daughter of John
    Washington, aunt of George Washington. His will is on record in Prince
    George County, Virginia. He was prosperous and left sons Sampson, Robert,
    Nicholas, John Thomas and Buckner.

     Nicholas Lanier, son of John Thomas Lanier, died 1779 and left two
    daughters.

     Sampson Lanier was the only surviving son of John Thomas Lanier and
    Elizabeth Washington Lanier. He died in 1743 also rather young, but lived
    a life of great usefulness as a plantation teacher and physician. His will
    in Brunswick County, Va. left large estate to Thomas Dannell Lanier;
    Sampson Lanier, Jr., James, Richard and Elizabeth.

     Thomas Dannell Lanier died in 1745 and left two daughters.

     Elizabeth married a Burch and second a Smith.

     Richard Lanier had sons Lewis, Burwell, Buckner and daughter Winnifred.
     
     Lewis, son of Richard Lanier, had a son Alexander Lanier that settled in
    New York City. Alexander had a son James D. F. Lanier.

     Burwell Lanier had one son David. David moved from Brunswick Co. to
    Pittsylvania Co., Va. in 1772. The land is in what is now Henry Co., Va.
    Va. records show that David Lanier was a Capt of a Co. in the revolution
    distinguished himself as a brave military genius. He married Miss Mollie
    Hicks.
                                   

Page 134
    
    David Lanier, Jr. had son James Monroe Lanier, grandson Charles and
    grandson James who named a son James Monroe Lanier, who was a Capt. in War
    of 1812. Was of fine personal appearance and was a large land owner in
    Virginia. Daughters of James Monroe Lanier, son of David, were Sally and
    Judith.
    
    John Hicks Lanier, Lucy and Nancy and Eliza were other children of David
    Lanier.
    
    John Hicks Lanier married a Miss Carter. She was the mother of his
    children and when he married a second time the children could not get
    along with the new wife and they moved to Missouri. Daughter Mary married
    and moved to Lincoln Co., Mo. She married John Lovell__ Children: John,
    Jr., Wilie and Allie. Son David had a daughter Mary. Mary first married
    James Jones and then a Ferguson. John Hicks, Jr. married Sallie Robinson
    and had children: David, Demarous, Mollie. Edward, son of John Hicks
    Lanier, Sr. married Jane and had two sons. Robert, son of John H. Lanier,
    Sr. married twice. His descendants live around St. Louis.
    
    Sampson Lanier, Jr. - Sampson died 1757, Brunswick Co., Va. and it named
    children:
    
    Buckner Lanier, son of Sampson, Jr. was famous for ability to settle 
    disputes. Well educated - physician and planter. Had one son Sterling
    Robert Lanier, son of Sterling, married Mary Anderson of Macon, Georgia.
    
    Sterling Lanier had sons Sidney, the poet, who died of TB contracted
    during the Civil War and son Clifford Lanier who went to Montgomery,
    Alabama and settled. Sidney Lanier was born 1841.
    
    John Hillery Lanier was son of Sidney Lanier. His children were John,
    Hillery, Robert, Benjamin, Samuel, Alice, Naomi, Aliph, and Bethesheba.
    
    Hillery Jones Lanier had the following children: Martin Penn, Daniel
    Walker Andrew Edwards, Green, Samuel, Beal, Louise, Serepta, Martha,
    Elizabeth, Mary.
    
    Daniel Walker Lanier married twice. By first wife Kate Brown children 
    were Florence, Henry B., Leon T. (Lee) and by 2nd wife, Sophie Egdoff they
    were Ernest, Bryant and Louella.
    
    Leon T. Lanier (Lee) married Trisita Marie Raine and his children were
    Don, Walker, Jack Farrell, Bert Rory, Leo D'Arcy, Leo Hillery, Norma, Rose
    Marie and two other daughters.
    
    This was notorized as a true copy of that copied by Mr. Lee Lanier of
    Amite La. 8-22-47 from Family Records of John Hicks Lanier, who moved to
    Mo. in 1845. The record was added to by John B. Lanier Pollard, grandson
    of John Hicks Lanier.

    These are old family records and are not documented; however, they are a
    good finding list. There has recently been published a book regarding this
    family that will bear out this information. Hillery and his brother
    Benjamin were in the Florida Parishes section of Louisiana as early as
    1873 but the court records do not show estate papers.

    settled in Augusta County, Virginia. The owner of this Bible was born in
    North Carolina. He came with his family through South Carolina, Tennessee
    and Georgia to Mississippi about 1810. They settled first in the lower
    part of the state near what is now Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Then most of
    the family went to Copiah County. Some of them went to Simpson County and
    the oldest son settled in Jasper County, Mississippi. (The Millsaps of
    Ouachita Parish, La. are descended from Uriah Millsaps, the oldest son.
    The family tradition is that Thomas, son of Uriah Millsaps, started to
    Texas and got as far as Trenton, Louisiana, when smallpox broke out in the
    wagon train and the wagon train never left this area.)

            "Knowing how great the loss of our fathers family Bible is, and
        that in a few more years the younger generation of our Grandfather's
        family will, to a great extent, know but little of our family history,
        the undersigned has thought to colate such facts as he remembers from
        conversations held with our father concerning his family history, vis:
    
            My grandfather, William Rownd, came to America at some time during
        the Revolutionary War. He came as an impressed seaman on a British
        vessel. He being an impressed seaman took unbidden leave from said
        ship and joined the American Army, this transpiring on the Chesapeak
        and eastern shore of Maryland. Our grandfather served from the time of
        his enlistment in the American Army until the Americans gained their
        independence.
    
            Subsequent to his army life he married and settled down in
        Worcester County, in or near Snowhill. Of this marriage one son was
        born named Lafayette, who in early life, prior to 1821, went to
        Cincinnati, Ohio. We have no date of grandfather's marriage to Uncle
        Lafayette's mother, nor the date of his birth, nor the date of his
        mother's death. Grandfather  married the second time to a Miss Sally
        Hutchinson, and she had a brother named Robert. Uncle Robert
        Hutchinson was a Baptist minister, and my brother Robert Hutchinson,
        was named for this uncle.
    
            Grandfather and grandmother had four children born to them, vis:
        William Scholfield Rownd, born the 14th day of Nov. 1812,
        John A. Rownd,Feb. 34d, 1816,
        Martha Ann Rownd, Feb. 17th, 1819,
        James J. Rownd, May 3rd, 1821.
    
                                     

Page 164
    
        Our Grandparents came to Louisiana in 1821. I presume in the fall
    of the year of 1821. Their moving to this state was by flat boat down
    the Ohio River to the Mississippi River. They landed at Baton Rouge
    which was but a small town in that day. On their trip down they passed
    Cincinnati which was a mere trading post, and many of the houses were
    made of split boards.
    
        Uncle John A. Rownd married a Miss Rebecca Tabor, of St. Helena
    Parish, La. and they raised quite a large family of children. Aunt
    Martha Ann Rownd married a Mr., Bailey Chaney of East Feliciana. They
    had no issue. Uncle James J. Rownd died just before lie arrived at
    manhood state. Our father, William Scholfield Rownd, married Miss
    Mahala Hodges, of St. Helena Parish. Our parents had born to them
    twelve children, viz:
    
    Mally Catherine, Margaret Ann, Benjamin F, Eliza Duer, William Buckner,
    Robert Hutchinson, John James, Elizabeth Mahala, Martha Rebecca. Abel
    Walter, Mordica Davis, and Andrews. Mordica and Andrews died infants and
    also Benjamin F. The surviving members of our family married and are
    residents of Livingston Parish, Louisiana, except Abel Walter who lived
    to be about twenty-four or five years old and died in 1891 of Lagrippe.
    
        Our father married second time to Mrs. Stilley, Widow of John
    Stilley. Mrs. Stilley had been previously married to a Mr. Wentmore.
    Of this marriage one daughter was born who married one of my boyhood
    friends, James Berlin Settoon.
    
        I expect to have some eight copies of this reference to our family
    history made and distributed among our loved ones., aid in conclusion
    will say that we are related to the Duers, Hutchinsons, Brittenhams, and
    the Scholfields, all of Snowhill, Worcester Co. Maryland.

             CLEMENT, MOSS, BEL, MOELING GOOS RECORD
    
    Mrs. Delia Bel Krause <address deleted>, Lake Charles, 70601, submitted
    7 pages of photostats to the Society in April of 1961. Some were written
    in German script. Volume III, page 2, of "Be It Known and Remembered"
    included a related record. Mrs. Krause has over 200 pages of Goos family
    data, and says that there is much information available on the Clement
    family, from Revolutionary times. Correspondence with Mrs. Krause has
    helped to take the information on the photostats and set it up in this
    form which will make it more easily followed. These records should be of
    wide interest. The photostats will be placed in the files of the Society.

                            GOOS RECORD
    
    Capt. Danile Johannes Goos b. 23 Mar. 1815 on the Island of Foehr,
    Schleswig-Holstein, Germany which was a part of Denmark at that time. He
    came to the States when he was 20, landing in Philadelphia, then came
    south to New Orleans where he met and married 26 Mar. 1846, when his wife
    was 16. They were among the earliest settlers of Lake Charles. Danile
    Goos died 19 May 1898.
    
    His wife was Katherine Moling, b. 11 Nov. 1830 at Neustadt on the Hardt
    in Germany. She died 11 Mar. 1884, Lake Charles. She was the dau. of
    Elias Moling who married in Bavaria in 1824 Anna Marie Gerig who died in
    Lake Charles 1878. Volume III, page 2 of these publications, gives his
    Bible record, listing several of his children, including Kathrina, but
    her birth date is given in error there as 1827. Mrs. Krause says she is
    sure 1830 is correct. The Moling Bible record also gives some, but not
    all, of the fifteen children of Kathering Moling Goos.

                    ROBERTS, WILLIAMS BIBLE RECORDS
    
    Mr. John H. Parker of Liverty, Miss., now retired, worked in the
    Courthouse there for many years. He has submitted to the Society, Feb.
    1964, 7 pages of photostats he made of an 1885 Bible in possession of
    Mrs. Pierce (Nettie Williams) Day, Rt. 1, Kentwood, La. The title page is
    missing, but the photostats include the one which tells "Abraham Roberts
    was borned in Marion District, South Carolina, August 26, A.D. 1784."
    
                                
    
Page 171
    
    The original Abraham Roberts III Bible is also in possession of Mrs. Day.
    The record pages have been torn out and lost. The front and back are of
    leather. Publication data show New York, American Bible Society, 1816. It
    is reasonably certain that the 1885 records were copied from the older
    Bible. Mr. Parker notes that in the original Bible, inside the front
    cover, the only writing is "Abraham Roberts was borned Aug. 26, 1785, and
    died March 3, 1863, being 77 years, 6 mos. and 26 days." Note that the
    photostat gives 1784 as the birth date. We have set the Bible information
    up in a more easily followed order, which has been checked by Mrs. Day.

                       ROBERTS FAMILY HISTORY
                                                                          
    
    In 1917 at Jena, Louisiana data were copied and included in the
    mimeographed included here.                                                
                                                                     
    In the latter part of the 16th century or the first part of the 17th cen-  
    tury Abraham Roberts emigrated from France to Marion District, South     
    Carolina. He was the youngest son. His family wished him to marry his
    cousin. He didn't love her and when he learned that she loved another,   
    he decided to go to America, then she would be free to marry her lover.  
    Abraham's parents were wealthy. The oldest son inherited the property.   
    They gave Abraham a large amount of gold which he brought to America in a  
    brown leather, iron-bound trunk. This same trunk was given the youngest  
    Roberts son through the years. Howard Roberts, son of Thomas Griffin     
    and Amanda Anders Roberts rightfully owned the trunk at his death.       
    Abraham I married in Marion District, South Carolina. He had several
    daughters and one son born ca. 1745 named for his father, Abraham II.
    In 1770 Abraham the second married Miss Desire Rogers. They had eight
    children who lived to be grown, four sons and four daughters.            
                                                                             
    In 1807 Abraham II with all the children moved from South Carolina to
    what is now Claiborne County, Mississippi.                               
                                                                             
    David, his oldest son, married a Miss Commander.                         
    Sarah, the second child, married a Mr. Hamilton. In 1809 Sarah and her
    husband moved to what is now Amite County, Miss. and settled on Beaver
    Creek. In a few years they moved to Franklin County and settled near
    the Homochito River where Mr. Hamilton died in 1811. His wife Sarah      
    survived him only a few years and was buried by his side near their
    farm residence, two miles north of Wilson's Ferry.

    James Polk Morris, Jr., Kentwood, La. Bennie, son of O.B., is a Baptist
    Minister. References to this family are found in Mississippi Baptist
    Association for 100 years, 1806-1906, page 25. Richard Curtis, Sr., left

    beliefs 1795 in this area. Listed in Salem Church, Jefferson County,

    stated that she had the Bible of her mother's father. With others, the

    From the diary of Solomon Morgan Brian, commencing June 1861, Evergreen
    Plantation, East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana:
    
            My grandfather, William Brian, emigrated from Ireland to America
    early in the 18th century and settled in South Carolina on. the Great
    Pedee River and he there married a widow Crocker, whose maiden name was
    Williamson, originally from North Carolina, and they had four children
    born unto them - Hardy, William, Francis, and Sara, and they all married
    and raised families. Hardy Brian, my father, was born May 20th, 1755 and
    remained in South Carolina, Darlington Co. until 1778. He then married
    Jemima Morgan, my mother. She was a daughter of Solomon Morgan who married
    a Miss Ludlow.  Solomon Morgan's ancestors were from Wales, and I am not
    informed at what time they emigrated to America. When the Revolutionary
    War of 1776 broke out, my father volunteered immediately in the defense of
    his country's liberty, and lie was in the army by turns for seven years,
    he fought under Generals Green, Sumpter, and Marion, and sometimes would
    join a small company to hunt out and check the Tories in their operations.
    At the close of the war he settled a place on Highhill Creed near
    Darlington Court House  where I was born in 1792. His four oldest children
    died in infancy; he raised seven children, and I was next to the oldest
    that was raised. In 1796 my father sold out everything that he could not
    move preparatory to moving to or near Natchez, Mississippi, and he was
    prevented from moving by an embargo being laid on all American vessels, on
    account of war that was expected every day with France, and at the same
    time the Cherokee Indians prevented emigrants from coming down the River
    at that time. He then bought and settled again on the Lake Swamp in 1798,
    opened a field, planted an orchard and in 1800 he sold his land and bought
    a place on horse branch near the long bluff on the Great Pedee,
    
                               
    and he remained on the place until 1806. He then sold out and moved to
    East Feliciana, La. It was then under the Spanish Government and remained
    so until 1810, when the inhabitants rose and took it from the Spaniards,
    that part of La. on the east of the Miss. River, known as West Florida
    and subsequently the United States took it from the Floridans and La. was
    constituted in 1812, and in July 1813 my father died at the age of 58
    years. He enlisted under the banner of King Jesus when he was quite young,
    before his marriage which took place in his 23rd year, and he made a
    faithful Soldier of the Cross, until the day of his death. He was raised
    an Episcopalian but when he came to years and was converted, he joined the
    Baptist Church and remained in it until the day of his death. He died full
    in the faith, he triumphed over death for it had lost its sting. He was a
    good man full of the truth and good works, and wherever he lived he was
    looked up to for counsel and advice, especially in Church matters. He was
    six feet in height, straight built, and weight, one hundred eighty pounds.
    I have heard him say that he never was intoxicated, or struck his
    fellowmen in anger in his life. He would often give good advice to his
    children, he taught them the way of salvation and gently led them on to
    Christ, and in worldly matters he would say never stand security for any
    man and if you want to whip the Devil just let him alone. Earn your bread
    before you eat it.
    
    He was poor in this world's goods but lived plentifully, laboured with his
    hands through life; he made his bread and meat at home, tanned his leather
    and made his shoes for himself and family, and my mother clothed them with
    her wheel, and cards, and loom. He held family worship night and morning
    through his life and if business called him off my mother would fill his
    place at the family alter and at the table, and I have great reason to
    thank God for such parents.
    
                                       (S) S. M. Brian
    
    The following letter was written by Wm. Sands Brian, son of S. M. Brian:
    
                                             Palestine, Texas
                                             April 16, 1878
    
    This diary was opened by my father, S. M. Brian and is now left for his
    son. Both parents have already passed into eternity and their children
    left to mourn their loss and profit from their example.
    
    Both Ma and Pa feared and loved the Lord and had faith in their
    intercessor Jesus Christ.
    
    On Thursday February 21, 1878, Ma left Port Hickey with Morgan Chance for
    my home at Palestine, where they arrived safely on Monday night.

    She remained with us until Sunday March 17, in usual health, then she
    was taken ill and died on Thursday evening March 21st. at 7:10 P.M.
    Ma. was allowed to be with us only three weeks and three days, when
    out Savior called and she had to obey.
    
    Dr's Hughes and Colley said her illness was acute inflamatory
    rheumatism, but she also had three congestive chills, Sunday, Tuesday
    and Thursday.
    
    This is indeed a very sad termination of her visit, which was so full
    of promise to us of happiness and joy.
    
    On Friday 22nd, 8:00 P.M. I started via Shreveport for Evergreen
    Plantation, with her remains. We arrived there Tuesday evening Mar.
    26th.
    
    On Wednesday 27th at 10:00 A.M. her remains were put in their final
    resting place by the side of Pa.
    
    Now both have passed away and no doubt are in that home of Eternal
    Bliss, where we all hope to be.

    Francis Brian (b. 1805) was a younger brother of S.M. Brian born of the
    same godly parents in East Feliciana, where he married Hannah Rogilio
    whose father was a Castilian Spaniard and mother the daughter of a
    Dutch farmer. From this union there were eight children, Hardy,
    Benjamin Franklin, and James, and Mary, Matilda, Martha, Lydia, and
    Elizabeth, all of these raising families. His wife, Hannah, died
    1/2/1846, and he married the widow Thompson whose maiden name was
    Salome Causey, by whom was raised Iley Marion, Solomon Morgan,
    Theodosia Adaline, and Francis Nathaniel who also all raised families.
    Francis Brian and family moved from East Feliciana to Caldwell Parish
    in Feb'y 1847, where he died on 27th of Feb'y, 1860 of paralysis. He
    was a devout leader of the Baptist Church and deacon in same. He was
    also noted for his fatherly advice and leadership in the communities
    where he lived. His son Benjamin Franklin, was my father, and was born
    in East Feliciana Parish 29th day of Nov., 1833. He moved to Caldwell
    Parish with his father in 1847 and in 1852, Nov. 18, he married Rosanna
    Roe of Winn Parish, his marriage licenses being first issued at
    Winnfield after organization of parish. My mother, Rosanna Roe was born
    on Big Creek in Grant (now) then Rapides Parish in Sept. 26, 1836 and
    her father was Samuel Roe and mother Rosanna Stevens also born in La.
    My father's children were Louisiane, Hannah Matilda, Laura Alie,
    Isabelle, Lydia, Hester (died infant), Hardy Lee, Harvey Iley, Francis
    Nathaniel, Mary Rogilio, and Zenobia Emiline. He was a blacksmith,
    running two forges when war broke out in 1861. He was rejected a
    volunteer in the infantry but joined the cavalry and served the
    Confederacy four years and twenty days, as
    
                               
Page 192
    
    cavalryman, courier and scout, coming home after Lee's surrender to
    find his $4000 in slaves freed, his trade all gone and six children and
    wife to support. He recommenced his blacksmithing on Fish Creek in
    Grant Parish (then Rapides) where the writer was born on 7/11/1865, and
    continued it till the railroads came with modern machinery.
    
    He joined the Baptist Church in his early married life and was
    ordained a regular Minister which he followed until his death. He died
    in Oct. 1896 of kidney troubles, on Big Creek where he had lived for
    twenty-eight years. He died in the full triumph of a living faith,
    regretting only that pecuniary circumstances had compelled him to
    almost abandon the ministry in the last few years of his life. He was
    beloved by all his neighbors and for miles around they came to see him
    in his last illness. For many years in eastern Grant he has been a
    kind of patriarch to the people - their doctor, their lawyer, their
    blacksmith, and their preacher - a father to the widow and orphan, and
    a patient arbiter of all their differences, and no amount of politics
    or new ideas on religion could or ever did wean them away from him. A
    modest marble shaft, in the Friendship Church graveyard marks his dust
    but his life is still bright in the minds and hearts of his neighbors
    and descendants, and his score or more of grandsons now reaching
    manhood can find no greater compliment to each other than "You show
    the blood of your old grandfather."

                        VAN WICKLE FAMILY DATA


The Van Wickle Family Data, submitted by Mrs. Sargent Pitcher, Jr.  Baton
Rouge, La.
The following information came to Mrs. Pitcher from Miss Elizabeth Knapp of
Mount Holly, New Jersey. 

Obituary of Jacob C. Van Wickle:  "On Sunday, Nov. 4, 1883 at 4 o'clock p.m.
in the 79th year of his age, Jacob C. Van Wickle, a native of New Jersey and a
resident of this State (La.) 60 years. 

His friends and those of his son-in-law, J. W. Devereux, are respectfully
invited to attend his funeral, which will take place this afternoon at 4
o'clock from his late residence - 
12 Esplanade Street, Corner Dorgenois.  (His picture appears in the newspaper
at this point.) 

At the ripe old age of 78, this estimable and well known citizen passed away
from earth yesterday evening at 4 o'clock, after a long, exemplary and useful
life as a man, a husband, a father and a friend.

Modest and retiring in his manner, quiet and gentle in his ways, of strong
domestic tastes, Mr. Van Wickle commanded the esteem, respect and confidence
of all who knew him. 

For many years he was a large sugar planter in the parish of Pointe Coupee and
owned the plantation now the property of the Hopkins Brothers.  He was Sheriff
for nine years; represented the parish in the Legislature, and after the war
represented the second levee district on the Board of Public Works and
superintended the last construction of the Grand, or what is better known as
the Morganza levee. 

In politics Mr. Van Wickle was an old line Whig and a recognized leader of
that party in Pointe Coupee.  When the question of secession arose he declared
himself opposed to it, and ran for the State convention on the co-operation
ticket but was defeated.  He, however, always doubted the policy of secession
and remained true to his convictions as a Union man.  But when the State
seceded and there was a rally to arms, the kind heart and generosity of "Uncle
Jake" as he was familiarly called, exhibited itself in his characteristic
unassuming and unostentatious way.  As the "boys" called to say "goodbye" to
him he would slip into their hands a ten, twenty or fifty dollar note,
according to their circumstances, and wish them a safe return, but with a
heavy heart, feeling that many of them he would never see again, and
foreboding the loss of their cause.  Nor did his goodness end here, for the
families of these soldiers were afterward the object of his protecting care
and generosity. 

At the close of the war, he came to New Orleans, having suffered severely in
loss of property, from the ravages of the Federal army, notwithstanding his
well-known loyalty to the Union, and engaged in the cotton press business,
leasing from his sister, Mrs. Wood, what is called the Canal Street Press. 
From that time in uninterrupted connections with his nephew, Jacob Van Wickle
(II ?), he conducted this business from 1865 up to the day of his death, to be
continued by his trusted associate. 

At the city election for Mayor in 1868, the conservative element of the
Democratic party brought Mr. Van Wickle before the nominating convention, but
he was defeated by two votes, lost to him because of his refusal to pledge
himself to two appointments.  Then when Kellogg was a candidate for the U. S.
Senate, Mr. Van Wickle was again solicited to contest the election, and
received the vote of the Democratic members of the Legislature.  His well
known integrity, purity of character and devotion to the interests of the
State, secured for him the confidence of political opponents.


Mr. Van Wickle was twice married; first to Miss Elezar Ledoux, by whom he had
two daughters, the surviving one having married first Mr. O. K. Dunning--
connected with the house of J. B. Burnside--and second to Mr. J. G. Devereux,
present cashier of the Hiburnia Bank.  His second wife was the Widow Dayries,
whose death occurred some two years ago. 

Mr. Van Wickle was a member of the Board of Directors of the Mutual Bank. 
Through economy, industry and fair dealing he amassed quite a fortune and the
last days of his life were consoled by the consciousness of having performed
his part well and that he left only friends to mourn his loss."
 
Jacob Van Wickle, noted above, was the brother of Nicholas Van Wickle of New
Jersey, whose family record, also supplied by Miss Knapp, is given below. 
Note there were two Jacob Van Wickles, uncle and nephew.

Note:  The Bible from which the above records are copied is inscribed:  "Sarah
McCarrell's Book, Presented by her son, Jesse H. Chaney, April 1, 1849." 
(Bible dated 1848.)  This record was sent to Mrs. Riddle by her cousin,
William A. Chaney, and it was copied about 1950.  Mrs. Riddle states that Mr.
William Chaney thinks that the Bible was in Rosedale at Halcomb Chaney's home,
but Mrs. Riddle's mother thinks it was in Greenville; Mrs. Riddle's cousin in
Greenville has a Bible but the family pages are missing; the "part that says
to my Mother, Sarah McCarroll is still a part of the Bible." Mrs. Riddle
further states that:  "This record was sent to Holcomb Chaney in Rosedale,
Miss.  When any of the Rosedale Chaney's lent it to family members to copy
they usually added an invitation to make any additions to it they could." 
(Editor's note:  Mrs. Riddle sent two copies of this Bible; one copy was typed
and is the one given above; the other was handwritten and varies a bit from
the one published here, but for fear of misinterpreting the handwriting, no
attempt was made to combine the two copies, both will be placed in files in
the State Library, where they may be studied by interested persons.  Mrs.
Riddle's note continues, and makes reference to a notation in the handwritten
copy).  "Someone did, apparently, in the note about Robert Chambliss Chaney,
but their additions are slightly incorrect.  He was supposedly born in or near
Lake Providence, Louisiana.  He did go to school and graduate from Centenary
College in Jackson, Louisiana with a degree in law.  He is buried east of the
town of Gillett, Arkansas County, Arkansas in Hinman County."  (Editor's note: 
Evidently referring to the handwritten copy, Mrs. Riddle continues)  "In
writing the record Lee Chaney also left off one child, Mattie Blanche Chaney,
born in about 1852.  She is a child of Sarah and Jesse Chaney.  The author of
this record, Mortimer Lee Chaney, was killed by a train in Cairo, Illinois on
November 1, 1898.  The above corrections must be with the Family Record
anytime it is read or copied.  I knew from first hand knowledge where he is
buried, I have his diploma and his daughter, my grandmother, was told by Col.
Robert Chaney and by his mother where he was born.  I lived with my
grandmother, Beulah Inez Chaney Lowe, from the time I was two years old until
I was seventeen."

marry Roger Wilson's children.  They lived in South Carolina and many of them
moved to Tenn. about 1800 with the Dobys, the James, the Stevens, the

M. Pipkin Feby. 14th 1869 in the Methodist Church, Clinton, La. by Rev. J. A.
Godfrey. 

A neat bronze monument marks the resting place of Martha Elizabeth, Rev.
Barnabas, Wilbur F., Mr. M. L. Pipkin and Henry W. Pipkin in Clinton-Pipkin
Cemetery; on said monument is inscribed their names with dates of birth and
death -- enclosed by a good iron picket fence.  The Cemetery is about 1 mile
northwest of the old Darlington Church (M. E. South).  This Feby. 13th, 1905
by L. M. Pipkin. 

Louis Martin Pipkin died March 25, 1920.  Aged 84 yrs. 1 month & 25 days. 
(Buried in Greensburg, La.).
Mary Elizabeth Lee Pipkin, third wife of Louis M. Pipkin died Sunday January
21st 1845 at Beachman' Memorial Hospital, Magnolia, Miss.  Buried in
Greensburg, La. Aged 84 years 28 days. 
Sarah Josephine Wright Pipkin wife of William Clinton Pipkin, died March 20,
1920, buried in family plot Greensburg, La. cemetery, aged 80 years, 4 days. 
Aunt Anna Pipkin's death was not recorded herein, but it was when Elizabeth
Baer was about 3 years (she must have died in 1911) old.  We went to funeral. 
Uncle Louis had this Bible but neglected to record her death.  It was not in
Bible when the Bible came into my Possession.  I regret very much that I do
not have exact date. Aunt Anna had not passed away when he (L. M. P. erected
the monument and dated his notation Feby. 13, 1905, herein.  (Written by
Martha Elizabeth Pipkin Baer -- she means her dau. Elizabeth Baer was about 3
years old). 

Funeral Notice:  Died -- At his residence in the Parish of St. Helena, La. on
Saturday, the 11th day of May, 1878.  Rev. Barnabas Pipkin, aged 83 years, 2
months and 14 days.
The friends and acquaintances of the family are respectfully requested to
attend the funeral of deceased, which will take place from his late residence
on Monday, the 13th inst., at 2 o'clock, P.M. Darlington, La. May 12, 1878. 

Martha Elizabeth Pipkin Baer was the only grandchild of Rev. Barnabas Pipkin
and her children and grandchildren are the only descendants of this noble man. 
In 1958 and 1959 she wrote some interesting letters to her newly found
cousins, Miss Lilla McLure of Shreveport, La. (of the Rev. Lewis Pipkin -
Daniel Griffin Pipkin line) and Lucie C. Price (of the Martin Pipkin line). 
Lilla McLure had succeeded in locating her through friends and relatives. 

Betty Baer:  "They said Grandpa Barnabas might have lived longer but he just
would ride horseback on his gentle old horse, Lucy.  He did not come in one
day so they hunted for him, found the horse grazing nearby and Grandpa had
slipped from saddle and was lying in the water of the small creek on the
place.  He was chilled.  Uncle Wilbur wrapped him in his coat and they put him
to bed.  At his age he was not able to survive the exposure so after a short
time he died.  When dying all were around his bed. He seemed to be smiling and
looking into the distance and mentioned his wife's name (Elizabeth Hanna). 
Papa asked him if he felt he was ready to go and he said "Do you think after
serving my Master all these years I am not ready to go - of course, I am."
Papa and Aunt Anna told this to me. -- Grandpa Barnabas did not preach at
Greensburg, La. church.  Their plantation was out in western part of St.
Helena Parish (near Amite River) and he preached at Darlington, old country
church, 12 miles west of Greensburg. -- The Clinton and Pipkin plantations
joined so it (the cemetery) is called Clinton-Pipkin cemetery. -- After Aunt
May died (Maria, Uncle Louis first wife), he married--Martha Vance Upson.  She
went to Centenary College too, at Jackson, La.  She married a Col. Upson
first.  Uncle Henry married a widow lady who never had any children.  My
father, Wm. C. Pipkin and Uncle Louis were graduated from old 
Centenary College at Jackson, La. and then studied Law.  Papa and Uncle Louis
were both County Judges, or Parish Judges, I should say in La. 

The following Successions (Wills) were filed and recorded in St. Helena
Parish, La.: Wilbur F. Pipkin, 1902; Henry W. Pipkin, 1905; Mrs. Maria Pipkin,
1905 (She and L. M. Pipkin lived at No. 152 Carondelet St., New Orleans, La.
when she wrote will.  She had been married to ______ Nevitt, a son, Arthur
Stotesbury Nevitt survived, her daughter had died at age four--Maria had a
sister named Stella Eugene Hunter); Judge Louis Martin Pipkin, 1920.

Editor's Note:  It is not clear, in the typed material sent by Mrs. Price,
whether all of the above data was included in the Bible.  It is all related
information and very valuable records and I am sure will be welcome
information for those members related to the Pipkin-Clinton-Williams families. 
For clarification on any particular name the Editor suggests that you contact
Mrs. Price, 2527 Harris Blvd.  Further, the following information, presumably
is included in the Bible, though in the typed material sent in, it follows in
